Simple seconds counter with three 7-segments digits.

Basic $2 board with STM8S103F3P6, reset micro USB conenctor and SWID interface used. 
Hardware connections:

LED:
Anodes (digits):
	0 GPIOC.3  / singles digits /
	1 GPIOC.4  / tenths /
	2 GPIOC.5  / hundredths /
LED Anodes are connected to +5V via PNP transistor driven from pins as above
PNP turns on by pulling bast to GND via GPIOC.3, GPIOC4  and GPIOC.5

Segments:
	a: GPIOB.4
	b: GPIOB.5
	c: GPIOD.2
	d: GPIOD.3
	e: GPIOD.4
	f: GPIOC.6
	g: GPIOC.7


Encoder:
	Pin A	GPIOA.1 (switches to GND, internal STM8S pull-ups used)
	Pin B   GPIOA.2

Encode Switch:
	GPIOD.6  (switches to GND, internal STM8S pull-ups used)
